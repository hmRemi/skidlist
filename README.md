## QuantamPhysic
- <b>Aliases:</b> Quantam, QuantamYT
- <b>Reason:</b> Decided to borrow @refactorinqq's NanoVG base (it's public) and called it his own (gradle & meta files are 1:1 üíÄ). Owns a client called Fluid, which is one of the worst clients in existence, needing to skid from quickdaffy's tutorials. Routinely copies designs & features from other clients. They added a feature ~1 day after another (less popular) client added it, goes to show how much of a skid they are.

## Refactoring
- <b>Aliases:</b> Ren, Luna
- <b>Reason:</b> Stated to possess expertise in the Java programming language but underwent a test that resulted in significant failure. Subsequently acknowledged being inexperienced.

## zsld
- <b>Aliases:</b> zenvunu
- <b>Reason:</b> Claims to be a Minecraft server developer but lacks any development experience, having never worked with any programming language in their life despite their claims of expertise.

## Meteor (aka. Retardeor)
- <b>Aliases:</b> iusemeteor, wagone, meteordev, meteorrrr, connerlinfoot
- <b>Reason:</b> Demonstrates dishonesty by habitually fabricating information. Attempted to sell my free and open-source plugins as his own, violating the terms of use. Lacks any proficiency in Java, resorting to seeking my assistance in setting up my own projects. Engages in unauthorized copying of various repositories, regardless of whether they are publicly available or not.

- <b>Evidence:</b>
   - <b>SimpleHubCore:</b>
     - üìÅ [RAR File Download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/hibz00r7kpz6h5d/proof_of_simplehub_being_skidded_by_meteor.rar/file)
   - <b>HyPractice:</b>
     - Discrediting by constantly denying that It's being used. After, the author is blamed on because It's apparently a fork of another core. Again, due to the premade getting leaked, all of a sudden the title changes to **"skidded core"** lol. [image](https://pasteboard.co/6nFKcjb7xs3t.png)
   - <b>AquaCore:</b>
     - Apparently, stealing code and "making it free" is not skidding and therefore invalid proof... [Image](https://pasteboard.co/6MT5MkvL1q47.png)

## Tabio
- <b>Aliases:</b>
- <b>Reason:</b> Employed as a developer for a Minecraft client, he allegedly "rewrote" their foundation with code of exceedingly poor quality. Additionally, he has been found to appropriate numerous utilities, falsely asserting authorship.

## EldoDebug
- <b>Aliases:</b>
- <b>Reason:</b> A 16-year-old individual from Japan who claims to be a "developer" owning Soar Client, a Minecraft client with a reputation for being poorly copied. Despite repeated testing, they have demonstrated a lack of genuine development knowledge. Their consistent behavior involves repeatedly utilizing skidded code from the client's inception, attempting to pass it off as their own. However, the codebase and design still clearly reveal its origins from clients like "Tenacity" and "Rise."

## Appu26j
- <b>Aliases:</b> Apple26j
- <b>Reason:</b> Self-proclaimed "developer" of the Apple Client, widely regarded as one of the poorest quality clients in existence. Routinely copies utilities from established clients. Displays limited expertise, resorting to manually drawing each module in his clickgui. Has declined multiple testing opportunities. Additionally, he is underage for Discord and other services, not making a wise decision by being on the platform. It should be noted that he also has attempted to distribute remote access trojans (RATs) within the community, a serious breach of trust and ethics.

## zash
- <b>Aliases:</b> zash.mx
- <b>Reason:</b> Posing as a web developer, he inquired about the visual appeal and cleanliness of a website he claimed to be crafting. However, it was later revealed that he was merely copying code directly from Bootstrap 5's examples, falsely asserting authorship. Furthermore, he openly admitted to engaging in skidding activities in the past.

## Lugami
- <b>Aliases:</b> Desistirei, Misureta
- <b>Reason:</b> Called ziue a skid üî•

## Cinger
- <b>Aliases:</b> Cingerr
- <b>Reason:</b> Called athena a skid and a rat üî•
