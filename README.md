## Meteor

## Tabio

Displays limited expertise, resorting to manually drawing each module in his clickgui. Has declined multiple testing opportunities. Additionally, he is underage for Discord and other services, not making a wise decision by being on the platform. It should be noted that he also has attempted to distribute remote access trojans (RATs) within the community, a serious breach of trust and ethics.
